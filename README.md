# Playground for procedural animation
Loosely, the end goal is to have procedurally animated fish that interact with one another.
A fun excuse to learn about procedural animation, and designing emergent behavioral systems.

### Created simple distance constrained chain procedural animation
![Distance constrained chain](https://github.com/HOWZ1T/proc-fish/blob/main/assets/gifs/distance_constrained_chain.gif)
In this example the head of the chain follows the mouse cursor, and the rest of the chain is constrained by a set distance to each other.
